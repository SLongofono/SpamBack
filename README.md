This is a little demo of how to use the Twilio API to make a simple call.
Running this script periodically via cron allows you to place the call over
and over.  The demo file is a recording of Rick Astley's classic "Never gonna
give you up".

Note that you need to actually set up a billable account to make calls.  You can
test this out on your own number for free.

Make sure that the xml file is hosted somewhere publicly accessible.
